# Exercise 4: Application Health Checks
OpenShift allows for two types of health probes: readiness and liveness. The readiness probe is used before the application is started. If the probe is successful the pod will be available to the service. Until the readiness probe is successful a pod won't be put into service. In the GUI the readiness probe is a light blue circle around pod. Once the readiness probe completes successfully, the pod is placed into service and will recieve traffic. This is shown as dark blue circle around pod in the UI. The liveness probe is run with regularity to ensure the pod continues to operate as expected.

OpenShift allows a probe to be defined by an http get, tcp socket or a command run in container. Typically you would want to provide an API /health endpoint and then if it is healthy a 200 returns. Sometimes though if you have a database you may need to actually run a command in the container to ensure it is healthy or even check tcp socket for non-http applications.

## Define Rediness Probe and Liveness Probe
Open a browser and connect to OpenShift. Go into your student project. Under application->deployment select the hello-kubernetes deployment. On the right under actions dropdown select 'Edit Helath Checks'.

Next select 'Add readiness probe'

Since our application uses http we will use a simple http get probe to test the application. Ensure the port is the destination port that the application is listening on within container, not the service. Set a delay of 30 seconds. In this case we are just using delay so we can see the readiness probe running. It will wait the delay time before doing probe. Set timeout to 5 seconds.

Next define a liveness probe. You can use same settings. Select save and then immediately go back to overview to see deployment happen live.

Go back to overview and select the error next to hello-kubernetes deployment to view details. OpenShift performs a rolling update. The old pod is still running (dark blue) while the new pod image is pulled. You will notice the new pod have a light circle for 30 seconds, this is due to delay of the readiness probe. Once readiness probe completes, the cutover is made to the new pod and it now has a dark blue circle while the old pod is simply deleted.

## View Health Probes in Deployment
You can of course add probes via CLI, they are simply a configuration of the deployment. Using the oc command view the deployment and you will now see the readiness and liveness probes.

```
